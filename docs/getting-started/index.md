Welcome to the **MOS** project!

To build MOS, several steps are required, this guide will walk you through the process of building MOS from source:

1. [Dependencies](dependencies.md): Install the required dependencies to build MOS.
2. [Configuring & Building](configure-build.md): Configure and build MOS.
3. [Running MOS](running.md): Run MOS on a virtual machine ~~or real hardware~~.
